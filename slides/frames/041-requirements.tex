\frametitle{Requirements Analysis (cont'd)}

We need to analyze the information content of the corpus text.

Classify each sentence or clause into one of the following categories:

\vspace{12pt}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Example} \\
\hline
Unchanging text & Thank you for considering rail travel. \\
\hline
Directly-available data & The next train is the Caledonian Express. \\
\hline
Computable data & There are 20 trains each day \\
 & from Aberdeen to Glasgow. \\
\hline
Unavailable data & There is snow on the track near Stirling. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{12pt}

By classifying sentences into categories, we get a better sense
of the difficulty and cost of implementing different requirements.
In the case of unavailable data, implementing the requirement
may be prohibitively expensive or impossible.
