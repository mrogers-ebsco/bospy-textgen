\frametitle{Mini-Project: Text Planning (cont'd)}

The typical output of the text planner will be:

\begin{itemize}
	\item One message about temperature.
	
	\item Zero, one, or several messages about weather conditions.
	
	\item Several messages may refer to the same condition (e.g. rain)
	at different time periods (e.g. Tuesday-Wednesday and Friday-Saturday).
\end{itemize}

Discourse planning: The temperature information is produced first.

\vspace{12pt}

Information about weather conditions should be grouped by condition.\\
The groups should be produced in the order that the conditions first occur.

For example, if today is Thursday, then we should
talk about the rain that's expected Friday before we talk about the
high winds predicted for Sunday.
